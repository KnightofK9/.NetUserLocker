Decrypt File
To decrypt the file, we'll follow the same process but using FileDecrypt instead. This method expects as first argument the path to the encrypted file and as second argument the path where the decrypted file should be placed. As third argument you need to provide the string that was used to encrypt the file originally:

string password = "ThePasswordToDecryptAndEncryptTheFile";

// For additional security Pin the password of your files
GCHandle gch = GCHandle.Alloc(password, GCHandleType.Pinned);

// Decrypt the file
FileDecrypt(@"C:\Users\sdkca\Desktop\example.doc.aes", @"C:\Users\sdkca\Desktop\example_decrypted.doc", password);

// To increase the security of the decryption, delete the used password from the memory !
ZeroMemory(gch.AddrOfPinnedObject(), password.Length * 2);
gch.Free();

// You can verify it by displaying its value later on the console (the password won't appear)
Console.WriteLine("The given password is surely nothing: " + password);
Final notes
The encryption/decryption process is memory consumming and take time so it's recommenda
